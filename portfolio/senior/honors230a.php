<h4>Honors 230A: Geographies of Peace and Violence</h4>
<p>
  This class taught me a lot of important ideas about social welfare, but it was a foreign experience for me. After being accustomed to problem sets with definite answers, it was hard
  to adjust to emotions and a lack of definitive answers.

<p>
  As my final project, I opted to research prison camps in North Korea and produce a short documentary. What follows is an unedited version of what I submitted for the class's required
  Honor Portfolio submission. The documentary is downloadable, but it's quite hefty (455MB).

  <h5>Prison Camps &amp; Defectors: A Documentary</h5>
  <img src="/images/pigeon.jpg" alt="Sketch of pigeon torture in North Korean prison camp" />

    The sketch shown here was drawn by Kwang-il, a former North Korean political prisoner. It depicts what Kwang-il calls "Pigeon Torture." In his own words:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "We are bound to stay in that position until the jailer feels that you have been tortured enough. So the torture goes on until the time has come to the satisfaction of the jailer. This is the pigeon torture. This is a very strange word in Korea and to you. Your hands are bound back and if they tie you like this, your chest comes out forward and in this position you are tortured."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Kwang-il presented this sketch to the UN's Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2013. The findings in the report reprimanded North Korean for their abuse of human rights, stating that the state had committed <strong>crimes against humanity</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through my research into North Korea, I conclude that the country epitomizes <strong>structural violence</strong>. The country's leader, Kim Jong-un, is the third in the Kim personality cult after his father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung. Under his leadership, the country continues to practice "military-first" economics while relying heavily on foreign aid and maintaining political concentration camps that imprison 200,000.

    For this class, I worked together with Kenzie, Jonathan, and Nick. Kenzie did service-learning with a reproductive rights organization, Jonathan researched hazing in colleges, and Nick did service-learning with an organization combating human trafficking. All of our projects involved <strong>basic human rights</strong>, so we tied them together in a presentation that started at the local level (hazing in college) and traveled to the internation level (human rights violations in North Korea). Our presentation can be <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZhwuB_YLeGxuZyu9sZxMZCWRroumrW1o98WY8d8kSc/edit?usp=sharing">found here</a>.

    For my final project, I created a <a href="final.mp4">short documentary</a> that outlined key areas of violence that North Koreans face. Beginning with a brief history of the country, the documentary then outlined the structural violence of the country by listing reasons a North Korean might be sent to a prison camp and the treatment they will encounter there. The video then expanded on the symbolic and structural violence defectors, especially women, may encounter if they try to escape the country. Finally, I concluded on a hopeful note by talking about organizations dedicated to building peace by helping North Koreans escape their life and start anew elsewhere in the world.
