<h4>Computer Science 331: Software Design and Implementation</h4>
<p>CSE 331 was the first upper-level computer science class that I took in the major. I enjoyed the content of the class and loved that each homework project built on the last. The final project in the class had us use our homemade graph to implement a map of the UW campus (think Google Maps).</p>
<p>However, I found the workload of the course much more difficult than any other class I had taken. My previous habits of beginning assignments the day before they were due began killing me. My Tuesday nights became hectic and stressful because I expected projects to take less time than I allotted. My downfall came near the end of the quarter when I turned in an assignment just minutes before the due date. After it was graded, I received a lot of points off because my graph traversal did not work correctly. I checked my code and learned that I had accidentally hard-coded the buildings the graph traversed and failed to notice because of stress.</p>
<p>Besides the wealth of information the class provided, I learned a lot about myself and my study habits.</p>
