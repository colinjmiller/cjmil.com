<h2>Honors Physics 121: Mechanics</h2>
<p>I took the honors course because physics had always interested me and it would fulfill several requirements. The class content, as a whole, probably wasn't that difficult. The reason I struggled in this class was because of my professor.</p>
<p>My professor, a nuclear physicist, took pleasure in belittling his students. This sounds harsh, but I'm not exaggerating. When a student had a question, he would scrutinize it and throw it back in their face. Sometimes he would ask people, "Do you know how to solve this problem?" and would expect students to simply answer yes or no instead of explaining how it's done.</p>
<p>My respect for him reached an all-time low near the end of the quarter. We were discussing orbital motion and our professor expected us to answer a clicker question in 90 seconds. The question required the use of formulas we didn't have on hand, so my friend asked him to put them on the board. The professor responded by saying he should be able to derive them from what he knows. We both looked at each other in disbelief. It had taken Kepler 19 years to formulate these equations, and now we were expected to find them and answer a question with them in 90 seconds.</p>
<p>I got a 46 on the first midterm, a 71 on the second midterm, and around a 50 on the final. I thought I had failed the class, but I ended up receiving a 3.5. Dozens of students complained to the honors office and we never got to fill out evaluations for the class. It was one of the most frustrating experiences of my college life.</p>
