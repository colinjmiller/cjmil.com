<h4>German 250: Advanced German through Film</h4>
<p>This class was a journey back to the past. The course was taught by Prof. Charles Barrack and involved watching short German skits shot in the 1950s or 60s. Most of the time, these skits were surreal and confusing, but I learned a bit of vocabulary and enjoyed the class as a whole.</p>
<p>As the quarter waned, Prof. Barrack announced that his TA was leaving and that he needed someone to replace him, so I said I was interested and he offered me the job. My brief stint as a German TA lasted for two quarters and I single-handedly decided grades and showed movies. The work wasn't as exciting as being a CSE TA, so I resigned after two quarters, but it was a helpful experience for me because it made me realize that new opportunities are out there; I just had to take the chance if I had it.</p>
