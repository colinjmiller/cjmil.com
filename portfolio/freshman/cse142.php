<h4>CSE 142: Computer Programming I</h4>
<p>Finally! The first class in my intended major!</p>
<p>Professor Stuart Reges was an inspiring lecturer. His teaching style confused me at first, but I found the pattern after the first few weeks. He would start by introducing a new topic for that lecture, then go down a seemingly random tangent that seems unrelated to the concept from earlier. By the last five minutes of class, I always seemed sure that he had messed up and would require extra time next lecture to wrap up the topic, but I was always wrong. He would reach a point in the tangent that logically looped back to the original concept and clarified everything. Applause was common.</p>
<p>I had expected the class to be a easy due to my previous experience with CSE. I soon found that only half the class was graded on making homework programs work; the other half was graded on the style of your programming. Since I had self-taught myself everything I knew, learning an entirely new style was difficult and resulted in quite a few lost points along the way. However, this skill is fundamental to computer scientists. Looking back, I'm surprised they didn't incentivize style even more.</p>
<p>I thought people were joking when I first heard the exams were hand-written. I couldn't believe that a computer science exam at one of the best programs in the world would require students to write code with a pencil and paper. However, it was true. I prepared by doing hundreds of practice questions on the textbook's website until I understood the pattern of questions that Stuart used on exams. I got a a 4.0 in the class.</p>
