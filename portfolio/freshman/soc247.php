<h3>Sociology 247: Introduction to Social Movements</h3>
<p>I took this class because I was limited on options and it sounded interesting. It was an interesting class, but everything was overshadowed by my naivety.</p>
<p>On October 16th, just a few weeks into the quarter, I went to Italy for a week on a scholarship. I had told my professors I would be gone, and they all wished me well on the trip. When I returned, I had a lot of make-up work to complete, but I was glad I had gone on the trip. I had taken hundreds of pictures and my professor in this class was especially interested in the trip. Since his last name was obviously Italian, I didn't think it was weird that he wanted to meet up for coffee at a caf√© so I could show him the pictures from the trip.</p>
<p>We sat for around two hours and talked. I thought it was great; I had always been told to get to know faculty members, and here I was, talking with my professor about something unrelated to school! When the meeting was over, we parted ways and I thought that was it. However, that's when he began texting me.</p>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure what was going on, but as time went on his intentions became more and more obvious: He was flirting with me. Hard. It began innocently enough, with him asking me about my day, but eventually turned unpleasent. He began talking about his latest bar adventures, who he hooked up with, and how great they were. He also began asking about me. Looking back, I should have done a lot of things differently; at the time I wasn't sure what to do.</p>
<p>Things finally ended when he texted, asking how I was. I replied that I was doing well and had had a chance to hang out with my girlfriend that day. He responded with "That's great, Colin!" and I didn't hear from him again.</p>
