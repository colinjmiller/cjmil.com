Math 126: Calculus III
After acing a very difficult quarter with Math 125, I thought I could take anything the calculus series would throw at me. For the most part, I did well. I had a lot of trouble visualizing 3D math and still have trouble remembering what taking the dot product or cross product of vectors gives me.
Our lecturer was very particular on day one that she must be addressed as doctor, because she had worked much too hard to be called anything else. She also laid out some other rules, such as no cell phone use, no talking to classmates, and sleeping was discouraged. It reminded me of high school.
The homework was easier than in Math 125, but I found myself being confused by elementary concepts of the class and it worried me. Nonetheless, I got a 96 on both midterms in the class and I felt assured of a good grade overall.
Midway through the year, she called out my friend Tysen and me for talking in class. Our solution was to go to her in person and give her chocolate. We think it worked well; she responded, "Now that's how you apologize! Everyone else take notes." When we were caught talking again, she stopped the lecture and said, "You two in the back: You'd better have more chocolate." We did.
The final was the day after my final German 304 play and I didn't start studying until that night. My strategy was to find the hardest homework problems and write down the solutions because time didn't permit for anything else. I got a 74 on the final, which brought my grade crashing from a solid 4.0 to a 3.5.
