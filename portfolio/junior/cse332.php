<h3>CSE 332: Data Abstractions</h3>
<p>CSE 332 is known as the "Interview Class" within the CSE department for good reason: You learn about dozens of data structures, algorithms, and core computing concepts that any tech company will surely ask about during an interview. I felt passionate about certain portions of the class, such as the Heap data structure. This was the first experience I had where I sat with my mouth slightly open as I learned of the extreme elegance of a data structure.</p>
<p>However, I still suffered from chronic procrastination. For two of the assignments in the class, we were encouraged to find a partner and code it out together. I chose to partner with my good friend and former roommate, Roee. Unfortunately, this partnership was doomed because we both started assignments much too late. We got away with starting an assignment the day it was due (we were given two weeks time for this) on the first part of the assignment. On the second portion, we began work the day after the project was due and ran into a series of comically unfortunate events: My power went out, we could not get GitHub to work with Eclipse, and Roee could not get Eclipse to compile or syntax highlight his code. In the end, Roee ended up using jGrasp to code and sent his code to me via e-mail. We turned in the project two days late and received 25% off the top of our grade because of it.</p>
<p>I completed the next project with Sam Tisdale, another good friend of mine. We began the project two weeks early and finished it at a leisurely pace. I had finally learned to overestimate the time an assignment would require.</p>
