<h4>CSE 457, 461, and 473</h4>
<p>I barely survived this quarter. Before the quarter, I had never stayed up for more than 22 hours. By the end, I had performed three all-nighters and learned that I did indeed have a breakpoint point.</p>
<p>CSE 473: Artificial Intelligence, sat on the back-burner of my priorities. I spent so many hours working on my other classes that I often began work on this class just a couple days before a project was due. Fortunately, the projects had regrade opportunities, so I could turn in a partially unfinished assignment, then resubmit it the next week for more credit. The course content seemed lacking, however; I had trouble learning in lecture and the assignments were almost complete before we began. I would have preferred to build the entire system and own it, rather than take someone else's code and muddle through it for hours.</p>
<p>CSE 457: Computer Graphics, was the most math-intensive class I took in the CSE department. I learned how modelers and shaders worked, how to implement a filter kernal, and even animated a short film for a final project! I felt quite dumb in some parts of this class because I had a lot of trouble transforming the lecture notes into code, but my classmates seemed to have little trouble doing it. The class taught me a lot about perserverence, though: Sometimes I have to rack my head against a problem for hours before gettign any insight.</p>
<p>CSE 461: Intro to Computer Networks, was the most difficult class I took at UW. In hindsight, it was one of the most useful classes I took, but I devoted more than 25 hours per week to this class. Luckily, I worked with a partner, Knick Adman, and we became really close friends during this time. Seeing the sun rise from the CSE building or walking home together at 4 AM became standard for us.</p>
<p>By far the most difficult assignment was the Tor project. For four weeks, my partner and I worked to understand, architect, and implement the Tor network. This brought on a lot of firsts in my life: Watching the sunrise from the balcony, drinking a Monster energy drink, and greeting the custodians as they came to clean the labs at six in the morning.</p>
<p>As an artifact of this experience, I have included the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/14sp/projects/proj3/proj3.html" target="_blank">assignment page</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/admannp/Networks/tree/master/src/Tor61" target="_blank">code repository</a> for this project.</p>
