        <p>
          The Treaty of Versailles marked the end of World War I and forced Germany to accept responsability for the war. Over the following decade, Germany's Weimar Republic brought the economy to shambles through hyperinflation as it tried to pay the required war reparations. Embarassed and losing faith in their government's ability to lead, many Germans began looking for new sources of leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in the southern region of the continent, Benito Mussolini of Italy was a rising star in the political arena. Although he ardently supported the socialist party until 1915, the Great War caused him to reverse his political orientation. He formed the Fascist Party in 1919 and gained massive support from unemployed war veterans, using their influence to terrorize the established political parties. After only two years, the Fascist Party was invited to join the coalition government. By 1925, Mussolini deposed the democratic government and established himself as dictator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in Germany, World War I veteran Adolph Hitler became interested in the German Workers' Party and the anti-Semitic, nationlistic, anti-Marxist ideas of its leader, Anton Drexler. Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills and passion, he invited Hitler to join the party. Hitler accepted, joining in 1919. By 1920, Hitler had become the party's chief propogandist, using his speaking skills to entice crowds to attend his speehes. Hitler used his influence to rename the party to the <em>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</em>, or National Socialist German Workers' Party, in order to garner more popular support.

          <span>A Scapegoat</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In order to appeal to Germans, the NSDAP had to unite the lower- and middle-class against a common enemy. Two of the biggest enemies in the eyes of Hitler included the Weimar Republic, which he believed had destroyed German pride, and the Jews, who he thought were destructive usurers that plagued society. Through passionate rhetoric and propaganda, these two groups served as scapegoats for almost all of Germany's problems.
        </p>
        <h3 id="scapegoat-weimar">The Weimar Republic</h3>
        <p>
          After World War I, the economic slump throughout Germany forced suffering upon many German citizens. Hitler and the NSDAP denounced the Weimar Republic and called the signers of the Treaty of Versailles "November criminals," which helped him win favor from unemployed veterans, farmers, and the lower-middle class. However, this small cohort of 55,000 was not enough. Inspired by Mussolini's successful march on Rome in 1922, Hitler tried to capture Munich in November, 1923. However, he was unsuccessful and ended up being senteced to five years in prison for treason, of which he served only nine months.
        </p>
        <p>
          In prison, Hitler realized that he must use legal means to seize power. In 1929, the global depression caused an already wary German public to lose faith in their government. Memories of hyperinflation from the early 1920s were still fresh and the NSDAP exploited that to appeal to the unemployed middle-class by blaming the Treaty of Versailles and its associated war reparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides promising to solve the economic crisis and restoring order, the NSDAP offered Germans something more valuable: Pride. No longer would they have to be ashamed of their country; they could have a sense of national pride and be able to spread it through the acquistition of <em>Lebensraum</em>. With each year, the NSDAP became more and more popular. On January 30th, 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of the republic through legal means.
        </p>
        <h3 id="scapegoat-jew">The Jew</h3>
        <img class="section-img" src="/images/fascism/ewiger_jude.jpg" alt="Poster for Der Ewige Jude" />
        <p>
          As Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels believed film to be a potent tool in molding public opinion. He thought that German cinema could serve as the vanguard of the Nazi military as they began conquering the world. An example of Nazi progaganda film is the 1940 anti-Semitic <em>Der Ewige Jude</em>, a twisted reproduction of 1934 British production, <em>The Eternal Jew</em>. However, unlike the original film that portrayed Jews in a favorable light, <em>Der Ewige Jude</em> mascaraded as a documentary and claimed to show realistic footage of Polish Jews before they hid <q>behind the mask of cilized Europeans</q>. In reality, the film was a complete manipulation, with many of its actors being forced to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film immediately begins by showing Jews in the Polish ghettos. The narrator claims that within hours of German occupation, Jews were swarming the streets, <q>back in business</q> as usual. While an ominous tune plays in the background, he continues by calling them <q>questionable figures</q> and <q>a plague</q>. The scene then changes to shots of men digging in the roads. The narrator explains that Jews don't often perform work or, when they do, it isn't useful. In this scene, he continues, the German military is making them clear rubble from the road, and the Jews don't like that. They don't want to work, he claims; they want to barter. Within minutes, the film has already dehumanized Jews, making them appear cold and calculating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film then tracks the origins of Jews, tracing them from the Middle East, down to Egypt, and across to Europe during the Roman Empire. It finally shows a map of world-wide Jewish influence, revealing large pockets around the globe. The narrator then reveals that this spread is strangely similar to another animal: The rat.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and foodstuffs. In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on. They are cunning, cowardly and cruel and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction - just like the Jews among human beings.

        <p>
          <em>Der ewige Jude</em> is but a singular example of the anti-Semitic thought that prevaded popular German media and thought. By establishing non-Jewish Germans against Jews, anti-semitic thought gave them a scapegoat to blame for their problems, and thus a goal.

          <span>The Nuremberg Rallies</span>
        </h2>
        <img class="section-img" src="/images/fascism/nuremberg_1923.png" alt="The Nuremberg rallies, 1923" />
        <p>
          Beginning in 1923, The Nazi Party held semi-annual rallies (<em>Reichsparteitag</em>) to promote the ideals of National Socialism and prove the power of the fascist movement. The first rally (pictured) took place in Munich, the second in Weimar, and then in Nuremberg from 1927 onward. These propoganda events lasted several days and featured speeches from influential politicians of the NSDAP who used the event to propogate, among other ideas, the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic, the need for <em>Lebensraum</em>, and the Jewish threat. The rallies grew in size and splendor until 1938. The 1939 rally, <em>Reichsparteitag des Friedens</em> or Rally of Peace, was ironically cancelled just days before its planned date due to Germany's invasion of Poland.
        </p>
        <h3 id="nurember-1927" class="u-cf">The 1927 Rally</h3>
        <p>
          The NSDAP chose Nuremberg for an important reason: It was the unofficial capital of the Holy Roman Empire and could serve to link the Nazis to the glories of Germany's past. Attended by 30,000, the 1927 rally proved to many within the NSDAP that this was a movement by the people.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          All National Socialists were proud that there was not a single conflict during the Nuremberg rally, despite the huge crowds. This is final proof of the fact that where National Socialism dominates the field, the German people’s community becomes a reality. The Marxists, as long as they were solid German workers, gave up all their protests and did not follow the incitement of their leaders. Yes, many citizens of Nuremberg saw to their astonished pleasure that German workers of the mind and hand, many of whom were known to be Social Democrats, were apparently overcome by the impression of the Swastika army and put on badges with our swastika and eagle. In working class districts where a National Socialist hardly dared enter in 1920 or even 1922, swastika banners were hanging from the fourth and fifth floor windows. These German workers had wakened from the betrayal of Marxism, and we raised our hands to them in the hope that they will one day join us, just like the whole group of former Red Fronters who on Sunday, 21 August, put on Adolf Hitler’s swastika arm band.

          Hitler's keynote speech condemned the leadership of the Weimar Republic and advocated expanding the German territories for <em>Lebensraum</em>. Summarizing his attacks against the Weimar Republic, Hitler stated that Germany <q>...wants a leadership in which it can believe, nothing more.</q> He also warned that if Germany does not expand its borders, feeding the nation's 62 million citizens would become more and more difficult, evolving from a question of economics to a reality of war.

        <p>
          Perhaps the most famous rally, the 1934 Nuremberg Rally enticed a crowd of 700,000 to join. As a show of power, the rally features a cathedral of light above the <em>Zeppelintribune</em> consisting of 130 anti-aircraft searchlights spaced 12 meters apart. Luftwaffe commander Herman Goering disliked using the searchlights in such a manner because it required almost all of Germany's strategic reserve, but Hitler saw it as a useful piece of disinformation, stating, <q>If we use them in such large numbers for a thing like this, other countries will think we're swimming in searchlights.</q>
        </p>
        <h4 class="u-cf">Goebbels' Speech</h4>
        <p>
          Joseph Goebbel, the Minister of Propaganda, gave a speech each year at the Nuremberg Rallies. In 1934, he talked about how propaganda helped over 16 million Germans during the winter by enlisting the help of 150,000 volunteers for the Winter Relief program.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Propaganda and education prepared the way for the largest social assistance program in history. They were the foundation. Their success was that, over a long winter, no one in Germany went hungry or was cold.
          <footer>

          </footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In the same speech, Goebbels defended Hitler's decision to leave the League of Nations in 1933 and pursue rearming Germany, attributing propaganda to earning Germany back its honor.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Over 40 million people approved of the Führer’s decision to leave the League of Nations on 12 November 1933. That gave him the ability to speak to the world in the name of the nation, defending honor, peace, and equality as the national ideals of the whole German people. The issues of disarmament were put on firm and clear foundations. Once again, propaganda was the foundation for the nation’s unity on 12 November, and therefore of the freedom of action that the Führer had in foreign affairs.

        <p>
          Perhaps the most famous example of propaganda film, Leni Riefenstahl's <em>Triumph des Willens</em>, or Triumph of the Will, chronicles the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. It begins with ominous music, describing the descent of German honor under the Weimar republic, but grows more optimistic as it transitions to the rise of Hitler. The camera is then in the air, following Hitler's plane as it prepares to land in Nuremberg. Hitler disembarks, and an assembled crowd bursts forth with shouts of "Sieg Heil!" People cry with joy upon seeing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitler's personality cult is evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire film has religious undertones in it. Hitler's descension from the plane is almost god-like--a messiah from the heavens coming down. For every Nazi official's speech, the camera is pointed upwards, placing the viewer at a lower point. Around 71 minutes into the film, Hitler is seen consecrating Nazi flags by touching them and shaking hands with their bearer; again, the religious comparison is unmistakeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides propping up Nazi officials, the film also depicts ideal Germans. While Hitler gives a speech to German youth, the camera pans over all the boys and girls assembled neatly in rows. The boys, dressed in similar uniforms, all have a fair complexion and blonde hair. While disembarking the plane, the camera briefly focuses on three healthy women wearing traditional German women's clothing as they clamour to see Hitler. Clean cut men in sharp uniforms listen attentively to all of the speeches, and even the elderly are seen nodding in approval to the words of the Nazis.

          <span>Forbidden Art</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          With the rise of the Nazi Party to Germany's leadership in 1933, Hitler saw how art could be used as propaganda to support his cause. In particular, Hitler wanted to unify the German people by giving them a past to be proud of and by providing a uniquely German art style. Much of the propaganda from this era uses Greek-like imagery to portray German men as fit, nationalistic, and ready to save the fatherland. Women are portrayed as mothers and caregivers, providing a safe home for their children and food for their husband. With Joseph Goebbels as the Minister of Propagandabegan, the Nazis began a push to bring German art and culture in line with their ideology. Two areas he focused on included modern art and literature. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="entartete-kunst"><em>Entartete Kunst</em></h3>
        <p>
          <em>Entartete Kunst</em>, or degenerate art, were works produced by artists that the Nazis deemed un-German. Degenerate art included works produced by Jews and communists, but also targeted many of the popular artistic movements of the Weimar Era, such as Expressionism, Dadaism, and <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em>, or New Objectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nazis seized works that did not conform to their ideals. Over 16,000 works were confiscated by the six person commission in charge of collecting degenerate works, sometimes with tragic results: Alfred Flechtheim, a prominent Jewish art collector and advocate of modern art movements, had his private collection confiscated and sold off. Forced to leave the country, he died in 1937 with few possessions. However, even members of the Nazi party were not spared; Emil Nolde, himself a member of the Nazi party, had over 1,000 works seized.
        </p>
        <h4>Emil Nolde's Portrait of a Young Girl</h4>
        <img class="section-img" src="/images/fascism/portrait-of-a-young-girl.jpg" alt="Emil Nolde's Portrait of a Young Girl" />
        <p>
          Emil Nolde, a prominent German expressionist and member of Die Brücke, was an early supporter of the Nazi party, sympathizing with its ideals in the early 1920s. He was antisemitic and believed that Jewish artists and their work were un-German. He also believed that Expressionism was a uniquely German art style, a belief held by other high-ranking Nazis like Goebbels. Indeed, Nolde enjoyed high praise by the German public until 1937, when Hitler declared that all forms of modern art, Expressionism included, were degenerate art. Nolde protested, but by 1941 was forbidden from creating any new artwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seen here is Nolde's <em>Portrait of a Young Girl</em>, which used bold colors and thick lines to depict a young girl. The girl's dark colors immediately set the mood as mysterious and perhaps even scary. Sharply contrasting this are the girl's lips, covered in scarlet lipstick. However, her lips are partially hidden in shadow, hinting that they have been involved in the dark and myserious activity suggested by the rest of the girl's appearance. It's possible that the young girl is a prostitute struggling to survive, but two notable features of the picture suggest an alternative: Her haircut and the gradient background. Her hair is bobbed, a popular look for New Women in this progressive era. The woman also seems to be striding forward confidently with her eyes wide open, looking toward the new opportunities afforded to her as a women in the early 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work was considered degenerate because it did not present accurate physiognomy of a girl and instead relied upon color for interpretation. It was displayed in Munich's 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibit.
        </p>
        <h3 id="book-burnings" class="u-cf">The Book Burnings</h3>
        <p>
          Goebbels also targeted literature that the Nazis found <q>un-German</q>. Aided by the National Socialist German Students' Association, the Nazis proclaimed a nationwide <q>Action against the un-German spirit</q> and aimed to utilize book-burning as the climax of this cleanse. On April 8th, 1933, the National Socialist German Students' Association published two theses, a reference to Martin Luther's 95 theses, of what designated German literature. Among other things, they attacked Jewish intellectualism and asserted that universities must be the center of German nationalism. They then burned over 25,000 un-German books.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book burnings included all the works of Bertolt Brecht, a prominent communist and author of works such as <em>Die Dreigroschenoper</em>. His works were burned because they criticized German middle-class society and Nazism while advocating Marxism. He fled Germany shortly before the book burnings.

          <span>German Resistance</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Between the years of 1933 and 1938, Hitler enjoyed almost universal approval in Germany. Many citizens had become disenchanted with the failures of the Weimar Republic and democracy and welcomed Hitler's leadership. To many, Hitler was a miracle-worker that restored full employment and annexed Austria without bloodshed. Despite little organized resistance during these five years, several groups and assassination attempts proved to be formidable opponents to Hitler's reign.
        </p>
        <h3>The SPD and KPD</h3>
        <p>
          As soon as Hitler became chancellor of Germany, he set about destroying the opposition. His hatred for communism and marxism became most apparent when he outlawed the Social Democratic and Communist Parties, imprisoning many of its leaders as <q>dangerous opponents of the regime.</q> The two parties continued operating illegal underground networks, but neither could come to an agreement and work together; their pre-1933 conflicts prevented that. Their members consisted almost entirely of disgruntled industrial workers who resented the stringent labor discipline, but a few leaders published reports of Germany's activities while abroad as well. Because of their inability to work together, these groups were unable to achieve much in terms of resistance.
        </p>
        <h3>The Church</h3>
        <p>
          The Catholic Church was the main source of opposition to Nazism during the 1920s and '30s. German bishops denounced its false doctrine, but Hitler fought back by banning all Catholic political influence and signing a 1933 concordat with the Holy See that prevented the clergy from participating in politics. Nevertheless, high-ranking Catholic officials continued to be a source of conflict; in 1937, Pope Pius XI wrote <em>mit brennender Sorge</em>, a fierce attack against the Nazi ideology and Hitler's personality cult. He had it smuggled into Germany to be read at the pulpit on Palm Sunday, one of the busiest days of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Catholic leadership continued to be defiant, even during World War II. The archbishop of Cologne, Josef Frings, made numerous reports on the persecution of the Jews and called them <q>crimes that cried out to heaven.</q> He attacked arbitrary arrests, racial persecution, and forced divorces, and called his diocese to not violate the rights of the Jews. Because of his popularity, Archbishop Frings prevented his imprisonment. He was closely monited by the Gestapo.
        </p>
        <h3>Assassination Attempts</h3>
        <p>
          Hitler survived many assassination attempts during his time at leader of Germany. He attributed each survival to providence, adding to the personality cult that he was indestructible. The first assassination attempt occurred in 1939, when Hitler was scheduled to make a speech at the beer hall in Munich where he had attempted to overthrow the local government 16 years earlier. A carpenter, Johann Georg Elser, spent a month before the scheduled speech sneaking into the hall after closing hours and hollowing out the pillar behind the podium, into which he placed a time bomb. Hitler's speech was much shorter than Elser expected, however, and he left the hall 13 minutes before it detonated, killing eight and injuring sixty others. Elser was captured and imprisoned in Dachau until 1945, when he was executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides attempts by German citizens, Hitler's army also made several attempts on his life. In 1942, Major General Henning von Traskow attempted to assassinate Hitler by placing a bomb on his plane. The bomb's pencil detonator went off, but the bomb did not--probably due to the cold temperature at such a high altitude. On July 22nd, 1944, an elaborate plan involving many of Germany's army attempted to assassinate Hitler in his Wolf's Lair during a conference. Claus von Stauffenberg placed a bomb inside his briefcase and positioned it under the table, then left on account of a personal phone call. The bomb detonated and killed four in the room, but only ripped part of Hitler's trousers.
